  <p class="que">1. Tell us your story. (in a minimum of 200 words)</p>
  <P class="ans">Putting in simple words, I am an ordinary person with extra-ordinary dreams. I always dream of giving something significant to the World, or playing a significant role in the growth and development of the World. After completion of my 12th class in Jaipur, which is my hometown, I got an opportunity to pursue my engineering in automobile branch from SRM University, Chennai. There came a twist in my life I dropped my college in 2nd year, and started giving my time and energy to a build a startup. If I will describe my life after dropping out college, it was kinda roller coaster, learn many things which I may not be able to learn in conventional way.  I spent my last few years in southern part of this country, which gave me a great opportunity to get along with diverse cultures and people. I see myself as an intellectual person who is interested in talking about space, time travel and other dimension things. I really feel astonished about coders and programmers, how do they make machines to do what they want and display what they want to see. Its kinda superpower of talking to machines and converting imaginary things into reality, that's the reason why without having a computer science background, I do want to learn it.  I have a good quality of getting along with strangers and turning them into friends, and a little bit good sense of humor.  In terms of work, I wonâ€™t just say that I am hardworking, I will prefer to say that I m an efficient person who knows how to manage work in stressful times. The one thing which I like about myself most is ability to getting over distractions to always keep myself align with my goals.</p>
  <p class="que">2. Why do you want to learn web devlopment?</p>
  <p class="ans">No one can deny the visible growth in IT industry and internet community, if anyone wants to be visible on internet or wants his business on internet, he needs a website. That itself shows the scope of people in web development. And for me it is really fascinating how we can think of an attractive, interactive image in our mind and then with the help of web development can convert it into a responsive website which can help people and businesses to grow themselves on internet which indirectly helps them to grow in real world.</p>
  <p class="que">3. Tell us a little bit about the person who has had the most impact on you and how?</p>
  <p class="ans">First person who comes in my mind after reading this question is my father, his unconditional love and hard work has a great impact on my life. But, almost every father has an impact on their child. So, I would like to share something more in this, from childhood I listened mostly hip-hop music, I love listening to rap music and even like to do rap. There is a person who is a rapper called "Divine", recently there was a movie on him named "Gully Boy". He is of around my age and belongs from a slum area known as "Dharavi" in Mumbai, from being a poor boy in slum to a rock star, he proved that if we are determined enough to do something in life even poverty and bad situations cannot hold us back. His story influences me in a great way and has a powerful impact on my life.</p>
  <p class="que">4. What's your preferred learning style? How do you think you learn something best?</p>
  <p class="ans">I usually prefer to learn things by executing the concepts in my practical life. I like to work on live projects to gain greater practical experience. Hit and trial methods are what I usually use to learn new things. I believe that facing obstacles and challenges while executing hit and trial methods makes a person more confident, as well as intellectually strong. Also, doing new things under the guidance and proper direction works really well for me. If this question is more about learning offline or online, then, i prefer to learn offline over online anytime beacuse online always miss out a energy which flows through teachers to students.</p>
  <p class="que">5. What's the hardest thing you have done so far?</p>
  <p class="ans">I should not describe it as "hardest" but yes it was really tough for me when I fought against my family, friends and many odds to initiate a startup in my college 2nd year. I felt really alone and helpless that time but somehow things happened and while sharing to parents about my dropout was really a scariest moment of my life. If rising up from being broken and going against people we love is hardest, then it was hardest thing I have done so far.</p>
  <p class="que">6. What do you think are your best qualities ?</p>
  <p class="ans">The clarity regarding fundamentals of life and the way I perceive it at the same time respecting everyone's perception even if its totally different from mine, I think its one of my best qualities. One more thing I like about myself is my emotional quotient. I m really good with my emotions. Other qualities like being cool in stressful circumstances, always trying to be a man of my words, and working hard for my commitments.</p>
  <p class="que">7.Why do you want to join AltCampus?</p>
  <p class="ans">I want to be very honest while writing this answer. I visited AltCampus website, I read the life at its campus page, and I started getting vibes , which I cannot ignore. I think AltCampus is the place where I can learn intensly, live intensly in a great environment with great company of mentors and students. I am at a point in my life where I want to explore my workaholic side, want to have a most out of my next few months. The best thing is income sharing agreement which makes it really simple to take decision without thinking about finances. I don't know whether I m lucky enough or not to be a part of AltCampus, but if I will make it up to there, its going to be a turning point in my career and even of my life and I will put all of my efforts to become one of the best student there.</p>
